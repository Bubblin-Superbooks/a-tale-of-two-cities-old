They had not been at home many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.</p><p>He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of speaking to him when no one overheard.</p><p>“Mr. Darnay,” said Carton, “I wish we might be friends.”</p><p>“We are already friends, I hope.”</p><p>“You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don’t mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.”</p></div> </div>
