If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it.

What do you say?”</p><p>“How long would you keep me in town?”</p><p>“Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”</p></div> </div>
