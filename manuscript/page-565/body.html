She had reserved this last evening for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.</p><p>“You are happy, my dear father?”</p><p>“Quite, my child.”</p><p>They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself in her usual work, nor had she read to him.</p></div> </div>
