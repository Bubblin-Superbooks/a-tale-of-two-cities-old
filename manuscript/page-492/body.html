Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”</p><p>“You hadn’t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”</p><p>“It’s enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn’t. A honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious woman? If you’re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have no more nat’ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”</p></div> </div>
