<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed.</p><p>“I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”</p><p>“Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!” his wife implored.</p><p>“You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don’t you?”</p></div> </div>
