Is it his child?”</p><p>“Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis—it is a pity—yes.”</p><p>The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.</p><p>“Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. “Dead!”</p><p>The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so.</p></div> </div>
