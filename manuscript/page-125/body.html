<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking.</p><p>It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the salutation, as if it were at a distance:</p><p>“Good day!”</p><p>“You are still hard at work, I see?”</p><p>After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the voice replied, “Yes—I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.</p><p>The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago.</p></div> </div>
