Do the days when you sat at your mother’s knee, seem days of very long ago?”</p><p>Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:</p><p>“Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!), and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”</p></div> </div>
