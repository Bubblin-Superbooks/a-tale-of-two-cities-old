She was a golden-haired doll!”</p><p>“Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”</p><p>“Quick to see what happened!

And now I’ll have no more drink; I’ll get to bed.”</p></div> </div>
