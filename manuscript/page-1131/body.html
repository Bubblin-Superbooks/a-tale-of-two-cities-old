<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>“What then, my gentle sister?”</p><p>“Do you think:” the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble: “that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?”</p><p>“It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there.”</p><p>“You comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now? Is the moment come?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other. The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before him—is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.</p></div> </div>
