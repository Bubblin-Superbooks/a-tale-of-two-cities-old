Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.”</p><p>“I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,” he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. “Miss Manette—”</p><p>“Is well,” said the Doctor, as he stopped short, “and your return will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.”</p><p>“Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.”</p></div> </div>
